Here's a plan to enhance the admin panel with a passcode and improve the UI:\n\nHere's what we'll do:\n\n1.  **Passcode Protection:** Implement a passcode for the admin panel to restrict access.\n2.  **UI Enhancement:** Improve the UI of the app to make it look more professional.\n3.  **Webhook Debugging:** Troubleshoot the Discord webhook integration.\n\nLet's start with the passcode protection for the admin panel. I will need to read the `components/AdminPanel.tsx` file to implement this feature.\n"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/AdminPanel.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "It seems the file `components/AdminPanel.tsx` does not exist.

This component is a generic bottom sheet and doesn't contain the admin panel logic directly. It seems the admin panel content is passed as `children` to this component.\n\nGiven the structure, the admin panel logic is likely within the `app/index.tsx` file, which controls the visibility of the bottom sheet and potentially renders the admin panel components inside it.\n\nTo implement the passcode, I'll modify `app/index.tsx` to:\n\n1.  Introduce a state variable for passcode input.\n2.  Render a passcode input field when the admin panel is triggered.\n3.  Validate the passcode against the correct value (\"logify@makers@91!@$%!\").\n4.  Conditionally render the actual admin panel content based on successful passcode validation.\n\nHere's the conceptual code modification for `app/index.tsx`:\n\n```typescript\n// app/index.tsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { Text, View, Image, TouchableOpacity, TextInput } from 'react-native';\nimport { commonStyles, colors } from '../styles/commonStyles';\nimport { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';\nimport SimpleBottomSheet from '../components/BottomSheet';\n\nexport default function MainScreen() {\n  const [isBottomSheetVisible, setIsBottomSheetVisible] = useState(false);\n  const [passcode, setPasscode] = useState('');\n  const [isAdminPanelVisible, setIsAdminPanelVisible] = useState(false);\n\n  const correctPasscode = \"logify@makers@91!@$%!\";\n\n  const handleOpenBottomSheet = () => {\n    setIsBottomSheetVisible(true);\n  };\n\n  const handlePasscodeSubmit = () => {\n    if (passcode === correctPasscode) {\n      setIsAdminPanelVisible(true);\n    } else {\n      alert(\"Incorrect passcode\");\n      setPasscode('');\n    }\n  };\n\n  const renderBottomSheetContent = () => {\n    if (!isAdminPanelVisible) {\n      return (\n        <View>\n          <Text>Enter Admin Passcode:</Text>\n          <TextInput\n            secureTextEntry={true}\n            value={passcode}\n            onChangeText={setPasscode}\n          />\n          <Button title=\"Submit\" onPress={handlePasscodeSubmit} />\n        </View>\n      );\n    } else {\n      return (\n        <View>\n          <Text>Admin Panel Content</Text>\n          {/*  Your actual admin panel components here */}\n        </View>\n      );\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <SafeAreaView style={commonStyles.container}>\n      {/* ... other UI elements ... */}\n\n      <SimpleBottomSheet\n        isVisible={isBottomSheetVisible}\n        onClose={() => {\n          setIsBottomSheetVisible(false);\n          setIsAdminPanelVisible(false); // Reset admin panel visibility on close\n          setPasscode(''); // Clear passcode on close\n        }}\n      >\n        {renderBottomSheetContent()}\n      </SimpleBottomSheet>\n    </SafeAreaView>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1.  **Apply the Code:** I will need to apply the above code to the `app/index.tsx` file.\n2.  **UI Improvements:** After the passcode is implemented, I can focus on making the UI look more professional. This might involve adjusting styles, colors, and layouts.\n3.  **Webhook Debugging:** Finally, I'll address the webhook issue. To do this, I'll need to understand how the webhook is set up and where it's being used.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-20T07:12:33.538625"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you add a passcode to the admin panel, fix the webhook issue, and make the UI more professional.
